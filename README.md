# Coronavirus analysis

This repo analyzes the activity of coronavirus hashtags on twitter from the past six months (from October 1, 2019 through April 5, 2020). 
This repo analyzes this activity of geotagged tweets and separates them by country and language. While geotagged tweets consists of a relatively
small percentage of the hundreds of millions of tweets sent out every day, they can still provide us with some important information. Most of the tweets
organized were (as to be expected) from the United States, but looking at each the difference in tweets from day to day attributed to each country
can show when each country's outbreak started as well as the severity in which those cases exploded.
